# Implementing-a-Image-classification-neural-network-to-classify-Street-House-View-Numbers
Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition
The Problem Description:
Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an important component of modernday map making. A classic example of a corpus of such street-level photographs is Googleâ€™s Street View
imagery comprised of hundreds of millions of geo-located 360-degree panoramic images. The ability to
automatically transcribe an address number from a geo-located patch of pixels and associate the transcribed
number with a known street address helps pinpoint, with a high degree of accuracy, the location of the building
it represents. More broadly, recognizing numbers in photographs is a problem of interest to the optical
character recognition community. While OCR on constrained domains like document processing is well
studied, arbitrary multi-character text recognition in photographs is still highly challenging. This difficulty arises
due to the wide variability in the visual appearance of text in the wild on account of a large range of fonts,
colours, styles, orientations, and character arrangements. The recognition problem is further complicated by
environmental factors such as lighting, shadows, specularities, and occlusions as well as by image acquisition
factors such as resolution, motion, and focus blurs. In this project, we will use the dataset with images centred
around a single digit (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides). Although we are taking a
sample of the data which is simpler, it is more complex than MNIST because of the distractors.
Dataset
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with the
minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem
(recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google
Street View images.
